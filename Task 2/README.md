# Task 2
This folder contains files related to Task 2 of the RISC-V Talent Development Program 2025.

## Files Included:
- `C Code Compilation.png`: Image file for Task 2 C Code to calculate the Sum of successive numbers from 1 to n(used n=100). Both GCC and SPIKE were used to compile the code.  
- `objdump of O1.png`: Image file for Task 2, disassembled RISC-V object dump for 'O1' optimization level of the C code.  
- `objdump of Ofast.png`: Image file for Task 2, disassembled RISC-V object dump for 'Ofast' optimization level of the C code.  

## Observation:
The -Ofast optimization level produces fewer instructions compared to -O1, demonstrating more aggressive and efficient optimization.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this folder is to document the progress and results of Task 2.   
Highlighted the impact of RISC-V GCC optimization levels (-O1 vs -Ofast) on the program's efficiency.
