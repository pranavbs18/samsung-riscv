Time to end 2024 with a bang and plan VLSI and RISC-V Workforce Development mission for 2025

Samsung Semiconductor India Research powers Digital India RISC-V Mission 2025

We are excited to announce a mission to train 1,000 RISC-V engineers across Karnataka. An initiative by Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR) in collaboration with VLSI System Design (VSD), it aims to nurture young talented minds through an intensive training program.

Highlights:

1) 6-week training program on RISC-V and semiconductor technologies.

2) Specifically designed for engineering students preparing for campus interviews who are interested to join semiconductor industry.

3) FREE RISC-V development boards for participants, provided by VSD.

4) Hands-on RISC-V workshops at 25–30 VTU colleges (focus on Tier-2 & Tier-3 locations).

5) Option to continue with an intensive online course for workshop attendees.
